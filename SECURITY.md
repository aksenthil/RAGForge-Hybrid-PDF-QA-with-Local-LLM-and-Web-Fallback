## Security Policy

- Report vulnerabilities privately via issues marked with the "security" label or email the maintainer if available.
- Do not disclose details publicly until a fix is available.
- Avoid uploading sensitive PDFs or credentials; the app stores files locally in `data/uploads/`.
